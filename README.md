# Tails Tracker

Tails Tracker is a simple application used to keep track of content to clear for the weekly event 'Wondrous Tails' in Square Enix's massively multiplayer online game Final Fantasy XIV.

## Usage

Clicking on any of the content blocks will add a reference to that content to the list displayed on the righthand side, which basically serves as a 'to-do list'. Once all content to clear has been selected, you can easily keep track of what is done or what still needs to be done by looking at the list.

Gone are the days of scrolling back in party chat to see which content you may have missed.

## Project Status

This project mainly serves as an environment to study the works of React and Redux and will receive attention until there's not much left to add onto this simple application.
